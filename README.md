Performed a Sentiment analysis using three different models on the same dataset of IMDB movie reviews [BoW, tf-idf, word2vec (RF and GNB), and BERT].
The sentiment analysis dataset was created with two columns, one with movie reviews statement called Text and the other column listing the sentiment named "Sentiment".
In order to classify the data, RandomForestClassifier and GuassianNB were used after using training the models above.
Performed LLM like DISTIL-BERT and BERT-base-UNCASED and compare the results.

Results of the Models:
TF-IDF Random Forest: 
Word2Vec Random Forest: 
BERT Logistic Regression:
